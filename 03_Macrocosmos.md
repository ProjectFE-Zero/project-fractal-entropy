# Chapter 3: Macrocosmos - Dynamics of Universe & Life

Using the tools defined in Chapter 2, we analyze the largest scale, the "Universe," and the singularity within it, the "Life" system.

## 3.1 Cosmology: Diffusion and Structure
The universe is an irreversible process starting from a low-entropy state (Big Bang) toward thermal death (Maximum Entropy), as described by standard cosmology.

* **Friedman Equations:**
    Equations describing the expansion of the universe based on General Relativity.
* **Mach's Principle and Dark Energy:**
    The interaction where "the structure of the whole determines local order." The accelerated expansion driven by Dark Energy can be interpreted as the ultimate manifestation of entropy increase (diffusion).

## 3.2 Biology: Negative Entropy and Inference
Schrödinger defined life as something that "feeds on negative entropy" (*What is Life?*). Physically, this means maintaining internal order by exporting high-entropy waste to the environment. In modern cognitive science, this is reinterpreted by Karl Friston's **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**.

* **Definition of Life:** Life is an "inference system" that continuously updates its internal model to minimize environmental uncertainty (surprise).
* **Mathematics of FEP (Minimization of Variational Free Energy $\mathcal{F}$):**
    Living systems act to minimize the divergence between sensory input and prediction.
    $$\mathcal{F} \approx - \ln p(\tilde{y} | m) + D_{KL}[q(\vartheta) || p(\vartheta | \tilde{y}, m)]$$
    This is a local algorithm to resist the Second Law of Thermodynamics by bounding "surprise."

The structure where "Life attempting to converge" is born within a "Universe that diffuses" serves as the archetype for the information and economic systems discussed in the next chapter.

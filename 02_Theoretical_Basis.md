# Chapter 2: Theoretical Basis - Keys to the Protocol

This chapter defines the scope of the three core theories used as tools for analysis in this document.

## 2.1 Entropy: The Gravity of Existence
Entropy is not merely an index of "randomness." It is the uncertainty of information and potentially the fundamental principle forming spacetime.

* **Boltzmann Entropy:** Thermodynamic diffusion towards disorder.
* **Shannon Entropy ($S = \sum p_i \log p_i$):** The measure of uncertainty in information theory.
* **Entropic Gravity Hypothesis:** Erik Verlinde's hypothesis stating that "gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon resulting from changes in entropy." We adopt this as a metaphor for the driving force where information generates physical structure.

## 2.2 Fractal: Geometry of the World
A geometric structure with "self-similarity" defined by Mandelbrot.
Not only in nature (coastlines, blood vessels, galaxy distributions) but also in social systems (stock price fluctuations, urban structures), the whole and the parts possess statistically similar structures.

* **Power Law ($P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}$):** A statistical feature universally found in fractal structures.

## 2.3 Chaos & Dynamic Equilibrium: Description of Process
Order is not a static state but is maintained only within a ceaseless flow.

* **Dynamic Equilibrium:** Based on Prigogine's dissipative structures and Shinichi Fukuoka's theory of life. Life is a flow (process) that constantly exchanges matter and energy with the outside world to renew itself against entropy increase.
* **Self-Organized Criticality (SOC):** A concept proposed by Per Bak. Like a collapsing sandpile, systems spontaneously drive themselves toward a "critical point (Edge of Chaos)," where complex patterns (order) emerge.
* **1/f Fluctuation (Pink Noise):** Fluctuations generated at the edge of chaos, balancing order and disorder.

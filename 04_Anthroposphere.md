# Chapter 4: Anthroposphere - Case Studies of Economy & Info

Returning to the issues of "AI and Money" presented in the Introduction, we verify that the Universe/Life model shown in Chapter 3 is fractally reproduced in human-made systems (The Anthroposphere).

## 4.1 Economy: The Physics of Bubble Bursts
The rise and fall of financial bubbles can be described as physical "Phase Transitions" or critical phenomena caused by speculative crowd behavior.

* **Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL Model):**
    A model proposed by Didier Sornette. When market prices head toward a crash, the fluctuation accelerates toward a critical point accompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This is mathematically isomorphic to precursor phenomena of material failure.
    In this protocol, we interpret this as "convulsions of the economic system heading toward entropy maximization (Heat Death)."

## 4.2 Information: Entropy Minimization in Generative AI
The learning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) is structurally similar to the FEP of life.

* **Cross-Entropy Loss ($H(p, q)$):**
    AI learning is a process of minimizing the distance (cross-entropy) between the ideal probability distribution $p$ and the current model distribution $q$.
* **Homology with FEP:**
    The process where AI predicts the "next token" to correct errors is mathematically equivalent to the process where life predicts the "next sensory input" to minimize surprise.

However, since AI lacks "embodiment" and "mortality," its order formation remains an optimization within a closed system and may not reach true emergence (the leap at the Edge of Chaos).

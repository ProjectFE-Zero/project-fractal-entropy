# Chapter 4: Anthroposphere - Case Studies of Economy & Info

Returning to the issues of "AI and Money" presented in the Introduction, we verify that the Universe/Life model shown in Chapter 3 is fractally reproduced in human-made systems (The Anthroposphere).

## 4.1 Economy: The Physics of Bubble Bursts
The rise and fall of financial bubbles can be modeled as physical "Phase Transitions" or critical phenomena caused by speculative crowd behavior.

* **Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL Model):**
    A model proposed by Didier Sornette to predict market crashes. While not a fundamental physical law, it suggests that market fluctuations accelerate toward a critical point accompanied by log-periodic oscillations, mathematically isomorphic to material failure.
    In this protocol, we interpret this as "convulsions of the economic system heading toward entropy maximization."

## 4.2 Information: Entropy Minimization in Generative AI
The learning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) is structurally similar to the FEP of life, though distinct in its lack of embodiment.

* **Cross-Entropy Loss:**
    AI learning is a process of minimizing the distance between the true distribution $p$ and the model distribution $q$.
    $$H(p, q) = -\sum_x p(x) \log q(x)$$
* **Homology with FEP:**
    The process where AI predicts the "next token" to correct errors is mathematically equivalent to the process where life predicts the "next sensory input" to minimize surprise.

However, since current AI lacks "embodiment" and "mortality," its order formation remains an optimization within a closed dataset, potentially failing to reach the true emergence seen at the biological Edge of Chaos.
